    <h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
    <p>Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.</p>
<p>Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. It is used to build server-side, input-output, event-driven apps. It is built on Google’s V8 engine.</p>
<h3>What is NPM?</h3>
<p>1.NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node dependency management.</p>
<p>2.NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation. NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code</p>
<p>3.NPM :NPM generates a `package-lock.json` file. the package-lock will generate the same node_modules folder for different npm versions</p>
<p>4.It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.</p>
<h3>What are the modules in Node.js?</h3>
<p>In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.</p>
<p>Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.</p>
<p>Modules are of three types:
    <ol type="1">
        	<li>Core Modules/Internal modules</li>
           <li>Local Modules/Custom modules</li>
            <li>Third-party Modules</li></ol></p>
            <h3>Difference between default export and named export?</h3>
            <p>Export objects, functions, variables from the module so they can be used by other programs with the help of the import statements. 
There are two types of exports. 
          1. Named Exports,
          2. Default Exports. 
Named Exports: Named exports are useful to export several values. 
During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.
Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file and were introduced with the release of ES2015.
 Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported. 
<pre>
 //Exporting individual features:
 export var name1 = …, name2 = …, …, nameN; // also let, const
// Export list :
export { name1, name2, …, nameN };
//Exporting everything at once :
export { object, number, x, y, boolean, string }
// Renaming exports:
 export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };
// export features declared earlier:
 export { myFunction, myVariable };
</pre>

Default Exports: Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable. During the import, we can use any name to import.Exports without a default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag are Default exports.
default export:- Using Named and Default Exports at the same time: It is possible to use Named and Default exports in the same file. It means both will be imported in the same file. Example: javascript.
<pre>
function defau(req,res){
    res.send("default exports")
}
function named(req,res) {
    res.send('named exports')
}

module.exports = default;//default export
module.exports = {named};//named export
</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>How do you import any module in Node.js?</h3>
    <p>Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code.</p>
    <p>Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in the imported module in another file. The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation.</p>
<pre>const f = require('./func')</pre>
