    <h3>What is Node.js?</h3>
    <p>Node.js is an open source and cross-platform runtime environment for executing JavaScript code outside of a browser.</p>
<p>Node.js is a platform for building the i/o applications which are server-side event-driven and made using JavaScript. It is used to build server-side, input-output, event-driven apps. It is built on Google’s V8 engine.</p>
<h3>What is NPM?</h3>
<p>1.NPM stands for the node package manager, npm is used for node dependency management.</p>
<p>2.NPM gets installed with NodeJs installation. NPM uses nested dependencies, so we can use different versions of any module in our code</p>
<p>3.NPM :NPM generates a `package-lock.json` file. the package-lock will generate the same node_modules folder for different npm versions</p>
<p>4.It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language.</p>
<h3>What are the modules in Node.js?</h3>
<p>In Node.js, Modules are the blocks of encapsulated code that communicate with an external application on the basis of their related functionality.</p>
<p>Modules can be a single file or a collection of multiples files/folders.</p>
<p>Modules are of three types:
    <ol type="1">
        	<li>Core Modules/Internal modules</li>
           <li>Local Modules/Custom modules</li>
            <li>Third-party Modules</li></ol></p>
            <h3>Difference between default export and named export?</h3>
            <p>Export objects, functions, variables from the module so they can be used by other programs with the help of the import statements. 
There are two types of exports. 
          1. Named Exports,
          2. Default Exports. 
Named Exports: Named exports are useful to export several values. 
During the import, it is mandatory to use the same name of the corresponding object.
Named exports allow us to share multiple objects, functions or variables from a single file and were introduced with the release of ES2015.
 Named exports are imported with curly braces in various files and must be imported using the name of the object, function or variable that was exported. 
<pre>
 //Exporting individual features:
 export var name1 = …, name2 = …, …, nameN; // also let, const
// Export list :
export { name1, name2, …, nameN };
//Exporting everything at once :
export { object, number, x, y, boolean, string }
// Renaming exports:
 export { variable1 as name1, variable2 as name2, …, nameN };
// export features declared earlier:
 export { myFunction, myVariable };
</pre>

Default Exports: Default exports are useful to export only a single object, function, variable. During the import, we can use any name to import.Exports without a default tag are Named exports. Exports with the default tag are Default exports.
default export:- Using Named and Default Exports at the same time: It is possible to use Named and Default exports in the same file. It means both will be imported in the same file. Example: javascript.
<pre>
function defau(req,res){
    res.send("default exports")
}
function named(req,res) {
    res.send('named exports')
}

module.exports = default;//default export
module.exports = {named};//named export
</pre>
    </p>
    <h3>How do you import any module in Node.js?</h3>
    <p>Importing functions or modules enhances the reusability of code.</p>
    <p>Importing a Module: We need to import the module to use the functions defined in the imported module in another file. The result returned by require() is stored in a variable which is used to invoke the functions using the dot notation.</p>
<pre>const f = require('./func')</pre>
<h1>Interview Preparation Day-2</h1>
    <h1> 1. What are the different types of HTTP requests?</h1>
<p>HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) specifies a collection of request methods to specify what action is to be performed on a particular resource. 
The most commonly used HTTP request methods are GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE. These are equivalent to the CRUD operations (create, read, update, and delete). </p>
<ul>
<li>GET: GET request is used to read/retrieve data from a web server.
GET returns an HTTP status code of 200 (OK) if the data is successfully retrieved from the server.</li>
<li>POST: POST request is used to send data (file, form data, etc.) to the server. On successful creation, it returns an HTTP status code of 201.</li>
<li>PUT: A PUT request is used to modify the data on the server. It replaces the entire content at a particular location with data that is passed in the body payload.
If there are no resources that match the request, it will generate one.</li>
<li>PATCH: PATCH is similar to PUT request, but the only difference is, it modifies a part of the data. 
It will only replace the content that you want to update.</li>
<li>DELETE: A DELETE request is used to delete the data on the server at a specified location.</li>
</ul>
<h1> 2. Explain the concept of middleware in Node.js?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Express.js is a routing and Middleware framework for handling the different routing of the webpage and it works between the request and response cycle.</li>
<li>Middleware gets executed after the server receives the request and before the controller actions send the response.</li>
<li>Middleware has the access to the request object, responses object, and next, it can process the request before the server send a response. An Express-based application is a series of middleware function calls.</li>
<li>The next() function in the express is responsible for calling the next middleware function if there is one.</li>
</ul>
<h1> 3. Explain CORS?</h1>
<p>CORS : (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a mechanism by which data or any other resource of a site could be shared intentionally to a third party website when there is a need. 
Generally, access to resources that are residing in a third party site is restricted by the browser clients for security purposes.</p>
<h1> 4. What is Express? How does it help you to create a backend application?</h1>
<ul>
<li> Express is a small framework that sits on top of Node.js’s web server functionality to simplify its APIs and add helpful new features.</li>
<li>It makes it easier to organize your application’s functionality with middleware and routing.</li>
<li>It adds helpful utilities to Node.js’s HTTP objects.</li>
<li>It facilitates the rendering of dynamic HTTP objects.</li>
</ul>
<h1> 5. Explain min 5 status codes gets used in Backend development?</h1>
<p>An HTTP status code is a message a website's server sends to the browser to indicate whether or not that request can be fulfilled. Status codes specs are set by the W3C. Status codes are embedded in the HTTP header of a page to tell the browser the result of its request. </p>
<ul>
<li>*102 PROCESSING Processing 200 OK OK </li>
<li>*400 BAD_REQUEST Bad Request </li>
<li>*401 UNAUTHORIZED Unauthorized </li>
<li>*402 PAYMENT_REQUIRED Payment Required </li>
<li>*403 FORBIDDEN Forbidden</li>
<li>*404 NOT_FOUND Not Found</li>
<li>*500 INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR Internal Server Error</li>
<li>*503 - Service Unavailable</li>
</ul>
<h1> 6. Difference between HTTP and HTTPS.</h1>
<ul>
<li>HTTPS is HTTP with encryption. </li>
<li>The only difference between the two protocols is that HTTPS uses TLS (SSL) to encrypt normal HTTP requests and responses.</li>
<li>As a result, HTTPS is far more secure than HTTP.</li>
<li>A website that uses HTTP has http:// in its URL, while a website that uses HTTPS has https://. Some difference of http and https;</li>
</ul>
<h1> 7. What are JWT tokens?</h1>
<ul>
<li> JSON Web Token, is an open standard used to share security information between two parties — a client and a server. </li>
<li>Each JWT contains encoded JSON objects, including a set of claims.</li>
<li>JWTs are signed using a cryptographic algorithm to ensure that the claims cannot be altered after the token is issued.</li>
</ul>
